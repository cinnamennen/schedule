I am running a printing company. Print jobs take a long time. When a print is finished it needs to be removed and the machine re-setup to start the next job. There are certain times of the day, e.g. night, lunch break, etc where there is nobody around to reset the printer so it must sit idle.  I have a queue of tasks that I want to run that are of varying lengths. I want to optimize my queue for minimal downtime, accounting for the job lengths and the periods where I cannot reset the printer. Are there any tools or algorithms that can optimize this for me
