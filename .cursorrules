# Cursor Rules
# Project-specific preferences and learnings that should be followed

## TypeScript Usage
- Prefer `satisfies` over type annotations when the type can be inferred
  ```ts
  // ❌ Don't
  const config: Config = { foo: 'bar' };
  
  // ✅ Do
  const config = { foo: 'bar' } satisfies Config;
  ```
- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError)

## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes except when truly needed
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication
- Avoid more than 3 levels of nesting in code
- Use arrow functions
- Use concise syntax for simple statements

## Project Structure
- Commands directory for CLI commands
- Services directory for core functionality
- Utils directory for shared utilities
- Types directory for TypeScript types and interfaces

## Error Handling and Validation
- Handle errors and edge cases early
- Use early returns for error conditions
- Use guard clauses to avoid deeply nested if statements
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly messages
- Place the happy path last in the function
- Avoid unnecessary else statements; use if-return pattern
- Use custom error types for consistent error handling

## CLI Design
- Support both positional and named arguments for flexibility
- Provide clear, colorful feedback for all operations
- Use consistent command patterns across the application
- Include helpful examples in help text
- Validate input early and provide clear error messages

## Development Process
- Think step-by-step before implementing
- Focus on readability over premature optimization
- Fully implement requested functionality
- Leave no TODOs or placeholders
- Be explicit about file names and paths
- Write clear, concise documentation
- Provide test commands after implementing features
  ```bash
  # ❌ Don't just implement without examples
  "Feature implemented!"
  
  # ✅ Do provide test commands
  "Feature implemented! Test with:
  $ schedule job add 'Test Job' '2h30m'
  $ schedule job list
  "

## Documentation
- Use markdown for documentation
- Keep examples up to date
- Include both simple and advanced usage examples
- Document both positional and named argument styles
