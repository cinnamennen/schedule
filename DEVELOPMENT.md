# Development Plan

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Data Input & Storage
Focus on core data management and basic output before adding complexity.

1. Job Input Commands
   - Create/edit/delete jobs
   - Job properties: name, duration
   - Flexible time unit parsing (15m, 5h12m, 1d5m)
   - Data validation

2. Machine Settings
   - Setup/teardown time configuration
   - Basic machine constraints
   - Settings persistence

3. Downtime Patterns
   - Daily patterns (e.g., lunch breaks)
   - Weekly patterns (e.g., weekends)
   - One-off exceptions
   - Pattern validation and conflict detection

4. Basic Output
   - Raw data dumps for verification
   - Simple text-based job lists
   - Configuration summaries

5. Data Persistence
   - LowDB implementation
   - Data schema design
   - CRUD operations
   - Data migration handling

### Phase 2: Schedule Visualization
Focus on making the data useful and visually informative.

1. Terminal Timeline View
   - Time-based visualization
   - Job duration blocks
   - Clear start/end times

2. Downtime Visualization
   - Visual downtime blocks
   - Pattern representation
   - Overlap detection

3. Job Sequence Display
   - Colored job blocks
   - Resource usage indicators
   - Setup/teardown indicators

4. Schedule Statistics
   - Total runtime
   - Machine utilization
   - Downtime impact
   - Basic efficiency metrics

### Phase 3: Scheduling Algorithm
Focus on optimization and advanced features.

1. Core Optimizer
   - Basic scheduling algorithm
   - Downtime avoidance
   - Setup/teardown optimization

2. Alternative Schedules
   - Multiple schedule generation
   - Trade-off analysis
   - Flexibility scoring

3. Resource Optimization
   - Resource-based job grouping
   - Minimize resource swaps
   - Group efficiency analysis

## Next Steps

Currently awaiting decision on command interface style:
- Interactive prompts
- Single-line commands
- Hybrid approach

After this decision, we'll begin implementing Phase 1 starting with the job input commands.
